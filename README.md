simple audio devices bluetooth manager, that lives on the tray - and supports easy multi-device usage through local network broadcasting.

upon startup it will show all audio devices paired. selecting a device will connect to it and select it as default audio output. selecting another device will disconnect the first one.

upon connecting a device, it will broadcast a message on the local network, so that other devices using bluebao can disconnect from the bluetooth device.
